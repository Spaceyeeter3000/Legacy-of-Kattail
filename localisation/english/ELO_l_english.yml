 ## Ideas

 ELO_meek_and_weak:0 "Meek and Weak"
 ELO_meek_and_weak_desc:0 "Out of all Herzland splinter states, Elowia is one of the weakest. Its people are scared by the looming tyrants that surround it and even the military takeover of their state feels civillian in comparison to all of their neighbors. But they can make a stand."

 ELO_bunkerhausen:0 "Bunkerhausen"

 ELO_fortress_laboratories:0 "Fortress Labs"
 ELO_fortress_laboratories_desc:0 "By extending the concept of §Y"Bunkerhausen"§! to include our §Yresearch laboratories§!, we can effectively continue research unbothered, even when facing an invasion.

 ELO_brunner_malus:0 "Reinforcing the Brunner Line"
 ELO_brunner_malus_desc:0 "We are currently strengthening our main defensive line along the Pawronne River! This spirit will disappear once we complete the associated focus."

 ELO_appeal_south:0 "Appeal to the South"

 ELO_prepare_counterattack:0 "Prepare for the Counterattack"
 ELO_prepare_counterattack_desc:0 "It doesn't take a genius to figure out that a war with the Regency is unavoidable, now that we have doubled down on our commitments to the south.

 ELO_internal_line:0 "Prepare the Internal Defense Line"
 ELO_internal_line_desc:0 "While the idea of the Brunner Line is quite a noble endeavor, the truth is that we cannot be expected to hold all of our territory.
