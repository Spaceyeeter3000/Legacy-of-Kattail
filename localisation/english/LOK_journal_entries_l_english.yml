This comes as a shock to Kepler an the world as a whole as the ship was thought to have been lost decades ago alongside all contact with Earth.\n\nReportedly carrying forty-million Terrans in cryosleep, the vessel has began extracting hydrogen from Mlekane's atmosphere to fuel their fusion reactor, and expect to be able to head to Flusion within the next year or so.\n\nKeplerite authorities have confirmed these informations, and will reportedly provide more details in the coming months."

The vessel quickly breaks apart into a swarm of burning chunks, most of which burn into nothingness as they reach atmospheric reentry. Only few pieces of the ship survive long enough to crash onto the planets surface. The main 'surviving' piece of the 'Joe Biden' crashes north of the Kepler Republic's Coast with an estimated casualty rate of about 90% \n\nThe projectile was seemingly launched from within Silbershirt territory. Elwin's government has made no statement on this seemingly sudden assault."
