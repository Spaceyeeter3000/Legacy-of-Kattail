 TAI_state_of_tailsbaden:0 "The State of Tailsbaden"
 TAI_state_of_tailsbaden_desc:0 "All things considered, Tailsbaden isn't doing too bad! Our position within the Katzen Mountains provides us with plenty of resources and strong natural protection against our would-be rivals. With such a generous position, it's time to evaluate our standing and decide where to go from there."

 TAI_brawnner_admin:0 "Review the Brawnner Administration"
 TAI_brawnner_admin_desc:0 "While Elias Brawnner has been doing a surprisingly good job at stabilizing Tailsbaden and its surroundings in the midst of the collapse, not everything is sunshine and rainbows. Corruption remains an issue while the socialist and liberalist militias of the IPF-KSK continually harass our state, viewing it as a prime target for the establishment of their order."

 TAI_captain_of_our_nation:0 "The Captain Steers Her Nation"
 TAI_captain_of_our_nation_desc:0 "Elias, who has until now been attempting to maintain the post-collapse status-quo, has to take a decision if Tailsbaden is to be spared stagnancy and destruction. Concessions were made with both the wealthy noble families and the military cliques of the area, but this delicate towing of the line can't last forever."

 TAI_return_to_the_old:0 "A Return to the Old"
 TAI_return_to_the_old_desc:0 "It is evident that the Kaiser's wanton militarism is what brought ruin to the Katzen species. Instead of foolishly re-attempting what has already failed, we should instead look to the past and specifically the era of the pre-Kaiser Cat Kingdom! While monarchism had its fair share of issues, modern technological and societal innovations shall allow us to merge the old with the new in a way that will surely return the Katzen species to glory."

 TAI_the_heir_debacle:0 "Filtering the Heirs"
 TAI_the_heir_debacle_desc:0 "The Cat Kingdom, while nominally centralized under the Mewtail Dynasty, used to be a veritable patchwork of noble families and dynasties holding various parts of the Herzlands. Many of these still exist today, and we must find the best candidates to lead our nation to glory."

 TAI_local_heir:0 "The Heirs of Purrgundy"
 TAI_local_heir_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Purrgundy used to be a powerful constituent state of the Cat Kingdom stretching across much of the central Herzlands, and even before that, it was one of the main candidates for achieving Katzen unification until the Katownite dynasties seized the opportunity."

 TAI_the_legitimate_heir:0 "The Legitimate Descendant"
 TAI_the_legitimate_heir_desc:0 "Forget all the noble rabble, what we need is a descendent of the only rulers that have managed to keep the Herzlands together for more than a generation - the Mewtail family. While the former old king Mewtail III which Kattail overthrew died decades ago, and his son was unfortunately killed by Silbershirts militia, his grandson Mewtail V is still hiding somewhere in the Herzlands..."

 TAI_reinstate_noble_titles:0 "Reinstate Noble Titles"
 TAI_reinstate_noble_titles_desc:0 "The first step towards preparing our return to monarchy is to officially reinstate the noble titles held by the various local families. While this will displease the lowly working class, securing the support of these great and influential Katzen families is obviously more important."

 TAI_mewtail_propaganda:0 "Monarchist Propaganda"
 TAI_mewtail_propaganda_desc:0 "A copious amount of propaganda aimed at our chosen dynast will convince the people of Tailsbaden and beyond that he is the right choice for our state."
 
 TAI_mewtail_guard:0 "Der Königlichegarde"
 TAI_mewtail_guard_desc:0 "In this era of fascists, capitalists and socialists, being a monarch isn't a safe job! We shall create a new police force dedicated entirely to protecting our noble families and our most beloved sovereign, as to convince them to accept our offer."

 TAI_proclaim_the_corronation:0 "Proclaim Mewtail's Corronation"
 TAI_proclaim_the_corronation_desc:0 "It is time! With Mewtail located and eager to reclaim his throne, we shall broadcast his grand corronation ceremony to the entire Herzlands!"

 TAI_summon_the_monarchists:0 "Rally the Monarchists"
 TAI_summon_the_monarchists_desc:0 "Across the Herzlands, from the fascist North to the capitalist South and the socialist East, nobles and monarchists everywhere struggle to find recognition. We shall officially proclaim Tailsbaden to be a free haven for these persecuted Katzens, so that they too may join our cause."
