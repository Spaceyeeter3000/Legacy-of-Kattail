Their extreme militarization coupled with fanatic military discipline and aggressive foreign policies often results in the Katzens being considered a hazardous species by their neighbors, which the Katzens usually inevitably attempt to take over at one point or another.§!"

(§YMostly Carnivorous§!)\n§LOriginally from Nienet, Katzenland's first moon, Sobaki history is closely linked to that of the Katzens, often in the context of brutal oppositions between the two species. Charismatic, bonded to communal ties and companions, Sobaki are known to be traditional and family-oriented. Their society is divided into various clans, headed by dynastic leaders known as 'princes' and elected rulers to oversee their land. When a threat emerges, the Sobaki will unite as one to confront it.§!"

(§0Lithoid§!)\n§LNekeox are a silicon-based lithoid species with a high-temperature metabolism - this and their solid excretions make them excellent living foundries. Their biological predilection for construction and manufacturing leads to a pervasively egalitarian outlook - an outlook exploited by the Kaiser as series of hung parliaments and ineffectual governments left the Nekeox military unable to resist a brutal Katzen invasion and decades-long subjugation. Consequently, Nekeox military foreign policy and strategy are defensively isolationist; individually, however, Nekeox are tolerant optimists, eager to cooperate with others.§!"

(§0Lithoid§!)\n§LKnown for their industrial prowess and attrition based defense doctrine as well as their hiveminded nature, the Nitromethanes as a species are one of the odder groups of people on Flusion. Due to their nature as a hive mind the Nitromethanes are naturally reclusive, opting to rely on themselves more so than others outside of their communities. Nevertheless, the Nitromethanes do occasionally venture out of their underground citadels for a variety of reasons, with most of them pertaining to the upkeep of their Military Industrial Complex that forms the backbone of their society. Due to their homelands situation within the Herzlands, being one of the few non-katzen peoples that originally hail from the region, the Nitromethanes have experienced first hand the aggression of the Katzen race, and are regularly less than friendly to Katzen controlled governments unless the benefits of aligning themselves with them outweigh their general dislike for the race. Nevertheless, they are not entirely trusting of any one people, making plans against many of their allies on a variety of occasions as a 'countermeasure' to betrayal.§!"

Ontop of a remarkably resilient frame, they also have keen senses allowing them to detect enemies far before they reach visual range or before the enemy finds them. Though their bodies require a large amount of nutrients to keep going, making food acquisition a very important priority."
