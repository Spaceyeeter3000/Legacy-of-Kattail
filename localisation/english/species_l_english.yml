Charismatic, bonded to communal ties and companions, Sobaki are known to be traditional and family-oriented. Their society is divided into various clans, headed by dynastic leaders known as 'princes' and elected rulers to oversee their land.

Their biological predilection for construction and manufacturing leads to a pervasively egalitarian outlook - an outlook exploited by the Kaiser as series of hung parliaments and ineffectual governments left the Nekeox military unable to resist a brutal Katzen invasion and decades-long subjugation. Consequently, Nekeox military foreign policy and strategy are defensively isolationist; individually, however, Nekeox are tolerant optimists, eager to cooperate with others.§!"

(§0Lithoid§!)\n§LKnown for their industrial prowess and attrition based defense doctrine as well as their hiveminded nature, the Nitromethanes as a species are one of the odder groups of people on Flusion. Due to their nature as a hive mind the Nitromethanes are naturally reclusive, opting to rely on themselves more so than others outside of their communities. Nevertheless, the Nitromethanes do occasionally venture out of their underground citadels for a variety of reasons, with most of them pertaining to the upkeep of their Military Industrial Complex that forms the backbone of their society. Due to their homelands situation within the Herzlands, being one of the few non-katzen peoples that originally hail from the region, the Nitromethanes have experienced first hand the aggression of the Katzen race, and are regularly less than friendly to Katzen controlled governments unless the benefits of aligning themselves with them outweigh their general dislike for the race. Nevertheless, they are not entirely trusting of any one people, making plans against many of their allies on a variety of occasions as a 'countermeasure' to betrayal.§!"

Ontop of a remarkably resilient frame, they also have keen senses allowing them to detect enemies far before they reach visual range or before the enemy finds them.

They are generally isolationist, avoiding contact with outsiders whenever possible and opting to preserve their idyllic and agrarian lifestyle at the cost of forgoing technological progress. Paluushes can reach enormous sizes of above five meters, which often makes interacting with other species difficult and forces them to consume tremendously more food than individuals of other species."
