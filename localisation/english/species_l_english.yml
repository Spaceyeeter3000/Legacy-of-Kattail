(§tResilient§!)\n§LIntelligent, loyal to their leaders as well as fiercely militaristic and nuclear-loving, Katzens are known for their extreme jingoism and hyper-militarizing of every aspect of their society. Their extreme militarization coupled with fanatic military discipline and aggressive foreign policies often results in the Katzens being considered a hazardous species by their neighbors, which the Katzens usually inevitably attempt to take over at one point or another.§!"

(§YMostly Carnivorous§!)\n§LOriginally from Nienet, Katzenland's first moon, Sobaki history is closely linked to that of the Katzens, often in the context of brutal oppositions between the two species. Charismatic, bonded to communal ties and companions, Sobaki are known to be traditional and family-oriented. Their society is divided into various clans, headed by dynastic leaders known as 'princes' and elected rulers to oversee their land. When a threat emerges, the Sobaki will unite as one to confront it.§!"

(§0Lithoid§!)\n§LNekeox are a silicon-based lithoid species with a high-temperature metabolism - this and their solid excretions make them excellent living foundries. Their biological predilection for construction and manufacturing leads to a pervasively egalitarian outlook - an outlook exploited by the Kaiser as series of hung parliaments and ineffectual governments left the Nekeox military unable to resist a brutal Katzen invasion and decades-long subjugation. Consequently, Nekeox military foreign policy and strategy are defensively isolationist; individually, however, Nekeox are tolerant optimists, eager to cooperate with others.§!"
