 CKG_event.3.a:0 "'Fine, fine... we can give her a honorary queen title without the wedding. Sob...'"
 CKG_event.3.a.tt:0 "Alice will be granted a honorary 'First Lady' title without actually being married to Mewtail. Not very 'in-protocol', but it is probably for the best. Mewtail won't be too happy, though..."

 CKG_event.4.d:0 "The wedding of Clatz and Mewtail has always been shaky. Mewtail had made numerous declarations of love towards Alice after the wedding and repeatedly attempted at wooing her, to which Alice responded either with relative indifference or with 'politically-correct' mild acceptance.\n\nUp until today when, during an interview about her personal life, Alice openly affirmed her love for none other than Fritz Purrlin, the former head of a northern Kaiserist movement recently stamped out by the Kingdom's military, going as far as to plainly state that they were engaged in a romantic relationship!\n\nWhile it was already known that Alice and Fritz enjoyed a close friendship despite their ideological differences, this essentially confirms Clatz's views of the royal wedding as being purely ceremonial, despite Mewtail's fiery displays of affection towards her.\n\nReactions within the Herzlands themselves are relatively mild, with many admittedly not being too surprised by this development, but it is outside our nations that the news have made the most impact. Other Herzlands states have openly criticized Mewtail as being 'emotionally immature', while across the channel, Roqualian tabloids and news outlet have been going crazy with sensationalist headlines giving our king fanciful surnames such as 'Kaiser Cucktail'\n\nThis is of course accompanied by a flurry of memes and edits spreading across the international scene, often depicting Mewtail as a weak leader being cheated on with Kaiser Kattail himself despite his best effort at stamping his influence out.\n\nMewtail is uncertain of how to apprehend the situation, having isolated himself in his apartments for the past few days..."

While it would ensure Mewtain retains his ability to realise his vision for our nation, it is a relatively ancient system of government and is seen by many as the reason for the first Kingdom's downfall.\n\nThus, many argue that we should instead aim for a more 'modern' constitutional monarchy where the people actually get in a say in the members of our government, and specifically its Prime Minister, via elections. The specifics of who can and can't vote will have to be decided later, but we must decide how much importance the Kingdom's constitution will have right then and now if we are to gain any legitimacy in the eyes of our subjects."

 CKG_an_alliance_with_the_zuspri:0 "Honor the Zuspri"
 CKG_an_alliance_with_the_zuspri_desc:0 "While we did have ambitions on the southern parts of the Zuspri Intermarium, Kattail went far beyond that and desecrated most of the Zuspri territories, leaving them as little more than a poor rump state. Rather than continue in his tracks, we should show the world that we are more honorable than the ursuper by returning Zuspri territories to their rightful owners, in exchange for their cooperation."

 CKG_the_great_airbase:0 "The Great Airbase of Kattenburg"
 CKG_the_great_airbase_desc:0 "Kattenburg used to be dedicated to Kattail's heavy aerial operations. Now that it has fallen under our control, we should strive to learn as much as we can from its vast stockpiles of heavy aircraft."

 CKG_the_great_dockyards_desc:0 "The great dockyards of Bamsens Dock were already under partial Katzen control during the first Cat Kingdom, and were then expanded by the Kaiser to serve as a logistical base for operations in the Katlantic Ocean. Let us ensure this crucial base remains able to support our fleets' logistical demands."

 CKG_reclaim_the_frontier:0 "Reclaim the Frontier"
 CKG_reclaim_the_frontier_desc:0 "The Imperial Frontier is a small state at the very edge of Felinea, whose purpose during the Kaiser's time was to establish Katzen settlements in former Zuspri lands. They will almost certainly be delighted to be brought back into the fold, where we will be sure to give them some extra work in the near future..."

 CKG_the_zuspri_march:0 "Establish the Zuspri March"
 CKG_the_zuspri_march_desc:0 "The savage Zuspri and their Intermarium are little more than a shadow of their former selves.

 CKG_fortify_against_the_nekeox:0 "Fortify the Nekeox Flank"
 CKG_fortify_against_the_nekeox_desc:0 "While the Nekeox themselves are of little concern to our safety, we should instead be worried about a foreign power overtaking them and using their lands to stage an invasion of the Herzlands. Fortifying the straits and isthmus leading into Nekeoxia will ensure such attempts are rendered moot."

 CKG_restore_bavawria:0 "Restore the Kingdom of Bayarn"
 CKG_restore_bavawria_desc:0 "The east is a complicated area, full of liberalists and democrats influenced by nearby Amphibia, who were barely integrated into the Cat Kingdom before Kattail's coup occurred. It might be wise to simply let them be and instead reinstate a semi-autonomous kingdom there."
 CKG_restore_bavawria_tt:0 "We shall establish the §HKönigreich Bavawrien§! in the lands of §HStruken§!, §HEastern Meownich§! and §HWestern Wacegia§!, if we control it."

 CKG_cross_high_sea_desc:0 "The port-city of Meorseilles was an important trading hub with the Sobakis and parts of the Sun Sea, but it seems it has now been overrun by crime and drug trade. We will not stand for this! If we're not the ones controlling the drugs, that is..."

 CKG_the_riches_of_the_katpines_desc:0 "The eastern end of the Katzen Mountains terminates in a dense massif known as the Katpines. It has generally been underexploited compared to the Central Katzen Mountains, thus let us make full use of its potential riches. It will also help bolster the newly-reestablished House of Bayern and ensure its control over the area."
 CKG_the_riches_of_the_katpines_tt:0 "If controlled by a puppet, will also get §G2§! §HMilitary Factories§! and §G2§! §HCivilian Factories§!."

 CKG_to_connect_our_kingdom:0 "To Connect Our Kingdom"
 CKG_to_connect_our_kingdom_desc:0 "The Katzen Mountains act as a near-impenetrable natural barrier between the North and the South. If we are to ensure this new Cat Kingdom is more united than the last one, we must bring down this separation by all means necessary. The engineers of Stronien will be of great use for this."

 CKG_royal_logistics_clique:0 "Establish the Royal Logistics Clique"
 CKG_royal_logistics_clique_desc:0 "The Transportstaat is home to the greatest engineers in the Herzlands, who have made it their duty to preserve Katzen public works expertise in these tumultuous times. Let us ennoble these stalwart defenders of Katzen expertise as to reward them for their work."

 CKG_mend_macaquian_ties_desc:0 "The Herzlands is home to sizeable minorities of Macaquians, whose relationship with the Katzen species has been most strenuous ever since the Crusade and the subsequent Collapse which saw Katzen overlords ousted from the Macaquian homelands.

 CKG_refurbish_auralian_docks:0 "The New Royal Shipyards of Auralia"
 CKG_refurbish_auralian_docks_desc:0 "The great Auralian bay was turned into a massive ship-assembling complex by Kattail, but we can't just let the usurper get all the credit, now can we?

 CKG_restore_purrsia:0 "Reinstate Purrsia"
 CKG_restore_purrsia_desc:0 "There still exists a huge amount of Purrsian nobles in the northeast. Granting them a vassal kingdom would certainly please them and ensure they fully support our cause."

 CKG_reinstate_king_walter:0 "Reinstate King Walter of Potkin"
 CKG_reinstate_king_walter_desc:0 "Long, long before Neumayer's desecration, the lands of Potkin were governed by a rather gruff king known as Walter, who swore partial fealty to Katown but retained some autonomy, before being turned into a mere figurehead when Kattail centralized the Herzlands. For all these years, Walter and generations of supporters have been waiting for an opportunity to return to power..."

 CKG_our_loyal_fleet_desc:0 "What remains of the Kaiser's navy have banded together in the Furrballeares in an attempt to preserve their mighty floating fortresses from warlords until a proper uniter comes around.

 CKG_strike_at_frankfurr_desc:0 "Frankfurr is where the Kaiser conducted most of his cutting-edge research. If we are to avoid stagnating like the previous iteration of our Kingdom, we must appropriate this research at once."
