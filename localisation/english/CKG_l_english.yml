 CKG_the_mewtails_heritage_desc:0 "The lands of Katown and Meo are where the Mewtail family originated and from where its power eventually grew to encompass the entire Herzlands.

 CKG_stamp_out_elwins_influence_desc:0 "Elwin's fascist order is nothing but a stain of the Herzlands, a continuation of the ideology order which brought ruin to the Herzlands. We must end it."
