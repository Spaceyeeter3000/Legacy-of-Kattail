 CKG_crush_silly_mechanists_desc:0 "While we can embrace progress, the idea of robots with souls is simply far too demented for us to lend it any sort of credibility.

 CKG_the_mewtails_heritage:0 "The Heart of the Herzlands"
 CKG_the_mewtails_heritage_desc:0 "The lands of Katown and Meo are where the Mewtail family originated and from where its power eventually grew to encompass the entire Herzlands.

 CKG_destroy_the_katzenvolk_desc:0 "A peculiar ideology pretending that the 'Herzlands are a tune to be sang together' has taken root northwest of Katown.

 CKG_integrate_the_rattish_desc:0 "Back during the Cat Kingdom's time, a large community of Rattish settled around the area of Clermeowth and Raita.

 CKG_crush_the_mad_herald_desc:0 "The Herald of the Kaiser and his Regency are perhaps the most vile and uncouth iteration of the Kaiser's ideology! Wanton murders and brutal oppression are the norm in these forsaken lands, and it is time for Auralia's rightful owners to take action."

 CKG_healing_the_scars_of_kaiserism_desc:0 "To mend the spirits of the Herald's traumatized masses will demand extensive effort and dedication, but it shall be done. Some may think that they're going from one oppressor to the next, but they won't dare complain."

 CKG_reconnecting_south_and_center:0 "House Clatz to Mend the Auralian Wound"
 CKG_reconnecting_south_and_center_desc:0 "The splitting of the Auralian megalopolis disrupted many logistical and supply chains between the southern and central Herzlands.

 CKG_down_south_in_capitalism_land_desc:0 "The South has developed a highly capitalist and profit-oriented mindset in the past decades, mostly thanks to heavy stimulus by Kattail to develop the Lionsburg region, as well as the area's proximity to Solakea facilitating trade.

 CKG_the_forges_roar:0 "The Forges Roar"
 CKG_the_forges_roar_desc:0 "The mighty Riesigerwerks of Lionsburg assembled some of the mightiest war machines in Flusion's history.

 CKG_hand_out_noble_titles_desc:0 "The South is full of entrepreneurs and business owners who set up powerful corporations offering goods and services to millions of Katzens. Why restrain them?

 CKG_southern_breadbasket:0 "The Kingdom's Southern Breadbasket"
 CKG_southern_breadbasket_desc:0 "Much like Clermeowth in the North, Catburg is the South's main producers of food thanks to its vast pasture and extensive forest-clearing efforts.

 CKG_strike_at_himezulte:0 "The Solakean Springboard"
 CKG_strike_at_himezulte_desc:0 "Himezulte served as the Kaiser's primary base for aerial operations in Solakea. While we don't have such brazen ambitions of conquest, it would nonetheless be a great asset should conflict arise in the south."

 CKG_a_modern_airbase_for_a_modern_kingdom_desc:0 "Niw that we have wrangled control of the southern Megaairbase, we should work towards modernizing it and learning from its vast aviation databases for the benefit of our own airforce."

 CKG_towards_the_frontier:0 "Seize the Little Katown"
 CKG_towards_the_frontier_desc:0 "Meon, known as the 'Little Katown', is a bustling cosmopolite city whose ideals of fevered technological advancement and disregard for ethics and tradition very much clash with our views.

 CKG_southern_center_of_learning:0 "House Highclaw and the Grand Duchy of Meon"
 CKG_southern_center_of_learning_desc:0 "We are advancing into lands which were little more than empty frontiers during the Cat Kingdom's time.

 CKG_southern_logging:0 "Sustainable Southern Logging"
 CKG_southern_logging_desc:0 "The great Drakwald forest has always been one of the Herzlands' greatest source of wood, but it has in recent times been more and more overexploited to the point of unsustainability. Worse still, several Kattail-era companies are actively destroying this great ecological site!

 CKG_drakwald_dams:0 "Dams to Tame the Drakwald"
 CKG_drakwald_dams_desc:0 "The vast Drakwald river flows through the southern Herzlands with tremendous force.

 CKG_feline_sea_ports:0 "The Great Ports of the Feline Sea"
 CKG_feline_sea_ports_desc:0 "Thanks to its closed-in and easily-defendable geography, the Feline Sea provides the Herzlands with the ideal place to construct and station our fleets.

 CKG_a_little_bit_of_stern_action_desc:0 "Well, the eastern communists and liberalists are harder to stamp out than expected. Nothing that a little bit of... stern action cannot fix. Sometimes, a monarch must show a strong hand, yes?"

 CKG_restore_order_to_the_east:0 "Bring Order to the East"
 CKG_restore_order_to_the_east_desc:0 "The quiet and quaint republic of Struken is an odd state.

Nevertheless it is in our advantage to restore order to these regions before their liberal ideologies can grow out of control."

 CKG_the_ludenclaws:0 "The Ludenclaw Quarries"
 CKG_the_ludenclaws_desc:0 "A compromise must be sought for the eastern Zuspri-populated lands: they shall be granted to the von Ludenclaw family, which were the ones originally assigned by Mewtail III to rule over whatever territories were to be seized from the Zuspri.

 CKG_an_alliance_with_the_zuspri_desc:0 "While we did have ambitions on the southern parts of the Zuspri Intermarium, Kattail went far beyond that and desecrated most of the Zuspri territories, leaving them as little more than a poor rump state.

 CKG_the_great_airbase:0 "The Great Airbase of Kattenburg"
 CKG_the_great_airbase_desc:0 "Kattenburg used to be dedicated to Kattail's heavy aerial operations. Now that it has fallen under our control, we should strive to learn as much as we can from its vast stockpiles of heavy aircraft."

 CKG_reclaim_the_frontier_desc:0 "The Imperial Frontier is a small state at the very edge of Felinea, whose purpose during the Kaiser's time was to establish Katzen settlements in former Zuspri lands.

 CKG_the_zuspri_march:0 "Establish the Zuspri March"
 CKG_the_zuspri_march_desc:0 "The savage Zuspri and their Intermarium are little more than a shadow of their former selves.

 CKG_fortify_against_the_nekeox_desc:0 "While the Nekeox themselves are of little concern to our safety, we should instead be worried about a foreign power overtaking them and using their lands to stage an invasion of the Herzlands. Fortifying the straits and isthmus leading into Nekeoxia will ensure such attempts are rendered moot."

 CKG_restore_bavawria:0 "Restore the Kingdom of Bayarn"
 CKG_restore_bavawria_desc:0 "The east is a complicated area, full of liberalists and democrats influenced by nearby Amphibia, who were barely integrated into the Cat Kingdom before Kattail's coup occurred.

 CKG_mend_macaquian_ties_desc:0 "The Herzlands is home to sizeable minorities of Macaquians, whose relationship with the Katzen species has been most strenuous ever since the Crusade and the subsequent Collapse which saw Katzen overlords ousted from the Macaquian homelands.
