#  lok_IPF_KSK_cat_desc:0 "Two powerful partisan networks known as the §2Interne Partisanenfront§! and the §RKatzensoldaten der Kernländer§! operate across the Herzlands.\n\nThe Interne Partisanenkräfte or Interne Partisanenfront (IPF) and originally known as the Anti-Kaiser Front (AKF) was formed about a decade ago by mid-ranking members of the Katzen imperial military who were disillusioned by the policies of the Imperium's leadership. Operations carried out by the AKF were mostly comprised of inside sabotage missions, propagandization, backroom assassinations, and misinformation among other things. Following the collapse of the Katzenartig Imperium and the Kaiser's subsequent disappearance, leadership within the AKF had no direction of what to do next. This quickly changed however, as the power vacuum left behind by the Imperium's collapse paved the way for new powers to rise up across Flusion, the most alarming being the Katsilbershirts and the Imperial Regency. Thus, the Anti-Kaiser Front reogranized into the IPF and made it their mission to fight these tyrannical powers within the Herzlands.\n\nFollowing the IPF's reorganization, the group transitioned from a secret backroom organization into a fighting force, even managing to carve out a territory of their own at one point. In the last couple years, the IPF fought several groups in the Katzen Herzlands including ultranationalist fanatics, marauder warbands, cultist alien worshippers, and more. Eventually the IPF came across another group, the §RKatzensoldaten der Kernländer§! (KSK), which was also made up of ex-imperial soldiers who had a similar goal of fighting off tyrannical warlords. Not long after, the two groups united and became what's known today as the §HIPF/KSK§!. As the years went on, warlords in the Herzlands begun to consolidate power and the IPF/KSK found themselves on the defensive against the larger forces in the region. The IPF/KSK were finally forced into hiding just a year ago following a terrible defeat in the §HBattle of Meowsden§! where, after bloody fighting across the streets of Meowsden, Silbershirt forces stormed their headquarters and killed off most of their leadership."
