 #Herzlands Unification

 herzlands_unification_cat_desc:0 "The Katzen Herzlands, once home to perhaps the mightiest empire in modern Flusionian history, lay shattered. The disintegration of the Kaiser's mighty Katzenartig Imperium has left the ancestral Katzen homeland fractured and divided amongst warlords vying for power and survival. But, all is not lost for the Katzen species. Although the situation looks dire now, time is famously known to heal all wounds, and a new power may perhaps emerge out of the ashes and one day reunite the Herzlands under an united government... or not.\n\nWarlord Type - [ROOT.GetHerzlandsWarlordType]\n[ROOT.GetHerzlandsWarlordTypeDesc]\n\nGiven our shared heritage, we will automatically §Gcore§! any Herzlands state that reaches §Y80%§! compliance.
