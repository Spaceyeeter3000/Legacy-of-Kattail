 HIM_bleeding_edge:0 "The Bleeding Edge"
 HIM_bleeding_edge_desc:0 "Although possessing among the finest aircraft in the Herzlands, Himezulte is small and constantly terrified of being reduced to irrelevancy by the superior industry and science base of its neighbors. As such, Himezulte is obligated to pursue aviation technology ever further, at the expense of all else."

 HIM_sudliche_flugschule:0 "Südliches Flugschule"
 HIM_sudliche_flugschule_desc:0 "Himezulte has cultivated the finest flight school in the Herzlands, well befitting its pilots but resulting in rather inferior training for even the most basic of land and sea measures."

 HIM_arsenal_of_aviation:0 "Arsenal of Aviation"
 HIM_arsenal_of_aviation_desc:0 "Himezulte's vast aviation facilities are perfectly tuned to the creation and repair of aircraft, but the result is other production branches being extremely makeshift, improvised and inefficient."
