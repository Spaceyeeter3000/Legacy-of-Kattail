Owing to its location deep in the Drakwald Jungle (intended to make it near-impossible to locate and capture), the base is nearly self-sustaining: it can extract and refine fuel for aircraft as well as manufacture numerous aircraft parts on-site even if bereft of supply lines from Katown.§!"

Rivaled only by the likes of the Frankfurr Institute and the Great Katownite Universities, the relative stability of Meon enables the university to attract numerous intellectuals and students seeking refuge from the chaos of the collapse.\n\nThe Universität has every course for whatever type of profession, whether experimental bio-engineering or some extreme niche part of physics. For this reason, almost all citizens of the Meon Bethacracy eventually pass through the gilded gates to make their way in the world. Much like the Meon Betharian Plant, the university is independent from the rest of the city although with much warmer relations between students and normal citizens.\n\nNew (and highly tested) GMO foods are grown here to feed the populace and the various engineering corps are often requested to make specific laboratory equipment. While students may often leave campus to explore other parts of the city, there are movies put on created by aspiring theater students regularly or shops temporarily run by business majors for their stay in the Universität. §!"

They have been in the family for centuries, from the Cat Kingdom era and even through the Kaiser's abolishment of the Katzen nobility, but were the tragic site of a recent massacre of its occupants by extremist anti-monarchist militias during the chaos of the early Katzen collapse. Nowadays, in an attempt to appease the various monarchist and traditionalist factions of the north, Elwin has had these estates turned into a public museum dedicated to the memory of the Von Kattensbach family and the history of Katzen nobility in general.§!"

Aiming to continue spearheading Katzen science despite the collapse, it offers scholarships to the brighest of students and funding to the most ambitious of scientists. Unbeknownst to most, the Institute's lower layers house numerous databanks containing classified research projects undertaken by the Kaiser ranging from Soulbots to Riesigerkatzenpanzers, either unfinished or heavily encrypted.§!"

The Tailsbaden Borehole was to be the first of a series of gargantuan vertical quarries, designed to reach dozens of kilometers into the crust both horizontally and vertically, reaping countless resources from the loaded depths of the Katzen mountains. Of course, no more such quarries were built, as the Imperium collapsed before it could be done, but the people of Tailsbaden have diligently continued to operate the megaproject, warding off heat and Poltro alike in an effort to enrich their desperate state further during the tumultuous times of the collapse.§!"

Nonetheless, the Superhighway was the key to the Imperium's rapid economical growth and it is right there in Stronien that most of the planning around the highway was undertaken. Entire cities were built dedicated to housing, educating and training the countless engineers and public works experts required to keep the project going, alongside vast factories to churn out the equipment needed to tie the continent-sized Imperium together.§!"

Ran by a conglomerate of Katzen and Rattish corporations mostly headquartered in the twin cities of Momoburg and Haselnuss, these hyperproductive apple orchards cover millions of acres and produce a staggering amount of high-quality apples which are then exported throughout the Herzlands and beyond in spite of the collapse.\n\nThese apples, distinguished by a tightly-controlled label, can be found from restaurants in Lionsburg through the rations of Tailsbaden mine workers to the meals served at university cafeterias in Frankfurr. The characteristics of this unusually successful production area have been the focus of numerous geographical studies, the results of which are often taught to rather indifferent Katzen students across the Herzlands as part of their geography courses.§!"

Invented by a brilliant Clermeowth-born Macaquian chemist, it provides incredible memorization capabilities for several days, allowing soldiers and planners to remember and execute battleplans near-flawlessly. Side-effects however manifest after a few days, and while more drugs were able to be produced by the Imperium to counter them, the knowledge to produce them has been essentially lost during the Collapse, meaning users of the drug often have to deal with splitting headaches and intense nausea. Regardless, the various crime syndicates of Meorseilles make massive profit by illegally providing Kiffrance to countless Katzens across the Herzlands, mostly students and small warlords desperate to accomplish something of note in these troubled times.§!"

With the Collapse essentially severing the supply chains of other companies, they have been able to grow immensely in size to the point of exercising a near-monopoly within Lionita, supplying essentially every pharmacy and hospital with the drugs they need to keep running.§!"

While it has caused much outrage within the Herzlands and especially beyond, supporters of the Neukat regime view it as an 'essential' reminder of what the role of Unterflusionians is - to serve the proud Katzen race and enable its ascension to the uncontested hegemons of the world.§!"
