 AUR_event.1.t:0 "The Wait for Him"
 AUR_event.1.d:0 "The Herald's paws tapped gently on his grand wooden task covered in extensive military orders, execution commands, and impossible industrialization demands. He knew it wasn't possible to do it all, but he had to make it real anyway.\n\nIt would be needed for when He came back. The Kaiser was so close to victory those GODS-RIDDEN, UNGRATEFUL, ABOMINABLE UNTERFLUSIONIANS somehow managed to stop His Imperium that ruled most of the planet.\n\nArmies that marched in the hundreds of billions, tech decades ahead of everything, culture more wonderful than any xenos artpiece, and so so much more. He, the Imperial Herald of the Kaiser, would make it back. He may of been a simple general-bureaucrat but he would show this planet that Kaiserism wasn't done with Flusion."
 AUR_event.1.a:0 "Announce the Dreijährige Reimperialisierung."
 
 AUR_event.2.t:0 "Dreijährige Failed"
 AUR_event.2.d:0 "They say the reason the Imperium fell was out of arrogance and the Regency was no different. Its predecessor was overwhelmed by vast tide of resistance by the unterflusionians, the strain of its exorbitantly priced superweapons, the megalomania of the Kaiser, and far far more. The Regency has failed in its plan.\n\nThe Herald has, supposedly, gone into a deep depression and refuses to leave his adhoc palace above the Auralianisches Platz. His council are whirling together what they can but even the political dissenter slaves know that something is wrong. Guards leaving positions because they aren't paid or maybe its the new ragged uniforms that can hardly be created anymore.\n\nThe people are suffering to the extreme and most of the population is rapidly on progress to become impoverished, starving peasants under the serfdom of some mad lord who made them work to death just to achieve… nothing of worth. This entire Reimperialization plan was a waste of time and effort and-\n\nThe metaphorical revolutionary Sobaks are baying for blood and they will find it soon. Kaiser save us all."
 AUR_event.2.a:0 "KAISER BLAST YOU ALL! IT IS STILL RECOVERABLE!. KILL THEM NOW!"
 AUR_event.2.b:0 "Do you hear the people sing, Herald?"

 AUR_event.3.t:0 "Dreijährige Reimperialisierung Utter Success!"
 AUR_event.3.d:0 "After three hard, long years of labor, the Imperial Regency is a roaring fortress of industry. Vast swathes of pollution clouds pour from Auralia towards the unterkatzens in the South. The great pre-collapse shipyards still churning out vessels to swarm the seas of the Kaiser. The rest of the Regency is the most developed in the Herzlands and is an astounding country-fortress.\n\nThe vast amounts of people worked to death and the strain on a barely post collapse economy trying to rebuild itself has snapped back. While we are greater, the Kaiser's gr eatest hope will need a recovery period before all the new facilities and our government to run at full operational capacity."
 AUR_event.3.a:0 "Excellent."

 AUR_event.4.t:0 "In His Tracks"
 AUR_event.4.d:0 "we love the kaiser!!!!"
 AUR_event.4.a:0 "Yes."

 AUR_event.5.t:0 "Base Camp"
 AUR_event.5.d:0 "Kitti Luft watched from the edge of the door frame as the Herald's police military handed the draft cards to both of her parents and handed over new schedules of their lives to train.\n\n“Herr Zuwulf... I have work in His factories-” Jovel began to speak before getting back handed by an armored glove. A small splatter of blood lazily hit the dirty floor.\n\n“You can work in the factory after training. Every day, every morning you will be there. At night you may work for pay. The Herald knows best.” The soldier spoke with disdain and disgust but he had shown mercy in not an instant shooting.\n\n“Danke Here Zuwulf. We will serve the Herald well.” Kitti's mama spoke up while her husband held a paw up to his jaw."
 AUR_event.5.a:0 "Kitti Luft missed Vater and Mütter reading her favorite story."

 AUR_event.6.t:0 "Imperial Regency proposes Meolowtof-Ribbawtrop Pakt"
 AUR_event.6.d:0 "Agents from the mysterious Imperial Regency have approached us bearing a highly-secretive proposal from the Herald of the Kaiser himself. Given the threat posed to both of us by the southern power bloc, they propose the 'Meolowtof-Ribbawtrop Pakt' - an agreement to strike the south at the same time and carve it up between our two states.\n\nNamely, they seek to take the lands of Purrlin-Lionsburg and Catburg, while we would recieve Lionita, Meon and possibly parts of the White Peak Rangers.\n\nWhile the Regency is... very much opposed to our ideals and beliefs, it is undeniable that the united south poses a major threat to us and that swift action must be taken if we are to contain its growth."
 AUR_event.6.a:0 "Let's work together... for now."
 AUR_event.6.a.tooltip:0 "Whenever the §YImperial Regency§! attacks the South, we shall join them and attack §YLionita§! and §YMeon§!."
 AUR_event.6.b:0 "Who does the Herald think he is?!"

 AUR_event.7.t:0 "Pakt Response"
 AUR_event.7.d.yes:0 "Our agents have informed us that the [regency_partner.GetName] has accepted the Meowlotof-Ribbawtrop Pakt.\n\nWe shall thus strike at the South together."
 AUR_event.7.a:0 "Most excellent news."
 AUR_event.7.d.no:0 "Our agents have informed us that the [regency_partner.GetName] has refused the Meowlotof-Ribbawtrop Pakt.\n\nWe will have to stand alone."
 AUR_event.7.b:0 "The Herald didn't need them anyways!"

 AUR_event.8.t:0 "The Herald Strikes South!"
 AUR_event.8.d:0 "The Imperial Regency has began its invasion of [PRL.GetNameDef] and [CAT.GetNameDef]. Thus, as per the Meowlotof-Ribbawtrop Pakt, it is now up to us to come to their aid."
 AUR_event.8.a:0 "Let us proceed."

 AUR_event.9.t:0 "Broken Souls"
 AUR_event.9.d:0 "The Herald wasn't lying when he said he was going to hang the spines of the IPF rebels on every townhouse. There were hundreds, rather thousands of spines across his Regency.\n\nHomes of dissidents were marked with the skulls of traitors so that neighbors knew to keep watch. The shallow graves given to rebels had their tailbones stuck lazily in the ground above them so all could know that they were COWARDS.\n\nThe Internale Partisan Fronte and their pathetic socialist allies remain active in most of the Herzlands but this gruesome mass slaughter has cut them off from infiltrating ever again."
 AUR_event.9.a:0 "I SAID KILL ALL TRAITORS!!"
 AUR_event.9.a.tt:0 "$ksk_strength$ decreases by §Y3§!."
 AUR_event.9.b:0 "Good... good enough."
 AUR_event.9.b.tt:0 "$ksk_strength$ decreases by §Y2§!."

 AUR_event.10.t:0 "Jovel Luft"
 AUR_event.10.d:0 "Kitti Luft begged her father to not go to work under the Herald's new economic plan. She heard from her teacher, the missing one, that it was dangerous. Bad work conditions and some other things that she didn't understand.\n\nWhen her father left anyway, she cried in her room on her half-dirt, half-rotten wood floor for hours. Her mother, Lucy Luft, tried to comfort her and tell her he would come back. Kitti didn't pay attention until hours later.\n\nHer father came back. She hugged him despite Jovel being covered in industrial filth and oil alongside a shellshocked look in his eyes. Kitti didn't notice, she loved her parents."
 AUR_event.10.a:0 "Jovel gave his little Katzchen a toy."

 AUR_event.11.t:0 "What Would He Do?"
 AUR_event.11.d:0 "The Herald stood on the balcony above the grand Auralianisches Platz in its namesake city. Thousands worked beneath him in what used to be a vast site of cultural celebration. He remembered the military parades of the Kaiser as well as showcases of the art seized from foreign conquests. Those unterflusionian arts had been melted down or burned after their ingratitude at His kindness. He wanted to make them all into Katzens! But they rejected Him!\n\nNowadays, the plaza was functionally an open-space workshop of putting together guns, filling ammo with gunpowder, creating anti-air emplacements, and military training all in one spot. It was a rather large plaza in that aspect and even larger with all the fountains removed. It wasn't the most efficient place he could put things but it let the Herald watch over their work. And the people could see that he was watching, that the Herald knew what was happening.\n\nSometimes they looked up at him before being driven away by taskmasters. He occasionally saw flocks of them perform their work slowly. Occasionally the Herald would even perform discussions with his advisors on the war plans although everything spoken loudly was propaganda. It showed an open trust in the crowds and how well the Regency was running even if it wasn't exactly true. Today, he looked out to the Auralianisches Platz and thought about what he would do today. What would the Kaiser be doing now? Not that he was better than the Kaiser."
 AUR_event.11.a:0 "The Herald gives orders from the Kaiser."
 AUR_event.11.b:0 "The Herald re-enacts one of the Kaiser's beautiful speeches."

 AUR_event.12.t:0 "Kleine Luft"
 AUR_event.12.d:0 "Kitti knew that she was't really allowed to have friends. Er, well, not that per say- she loved this phrase after reading it from a rare book- but not any “foreign” friends. She had one technically, no body knew about him. He was a few years older than her, an adult but she was grown up enough to talk with him. His name was Dewy.\n\nDewy says he was apart of a bigger friend group from South Auralia that wanted to bring back voting and things like that. She didn't really know what he meant by that and he never wanted to stay long enough to explain it to her. Kitti was seven and her friend said he was about eleven or so, he said he was one of the youngest members of the friend group.\n\nOne day, the Herald announced something like more coastal defense boats and stronger borders. Her friend came over one last time and said his goodbyes. Kitti Luft didn't really understand why he wasn't coming back but she hugged him one last time." 
 AUR_event.12.a:0 "An IPF agent was shot border-crossing with a hand-carved wooden tank toy in his paw."

 AUR_event.13.t:0 "Traitor Execution List #7829-KV"
 AUR_event.13.d:0 "Olanius Pawious, factory union leader, sent to the Kittville Nordarbeit Labor Camp.\nDebramaw Neirch, revolutionary, publicly shot.\nScritch Schuss, cultural deviant, fired from public service; placed on watch list.\nLeopold Purrberg, espionage, shot.\nFelix Fürst, illegal belongings, all possessions seized by the Herald.\nMiau von Spielburg, sabotage, tortured for KSK knowledge; publicly shot.\nKitti Luft, escapee-\n\n[OPEN FILE]\nKitti Luft belonged to the worker class family of Jovel and Lucy Luft. Both parents served the state admirably and have no on record complaints of the system. Lucy Luft was on track to become an officer. Kitti Luft admitted to having dealings with an IPF terrorist where she got the idea to leave the country. Despite increased border security, she escaped and was welcomed across the Meowignot Line by Republican troops.\n\nDue to her insignificance in the Regency, she had no new information to give to the South although admitted to telling them everything she could. She was sent into a foster home where she lived for at least a year while 'trying to fix her life.' Openly resisted the Kaiser's forces when they entered Lionsburg and joined into the Anti-Kaiserist Lionsburgite Legion. The Legion was forced into hiding with the capitulation of southern Felinea.\n\nKitti Luft was apprehended and interrogated within Kittville which happened to be her home town. She has been sent to the Kittville Nordarbeit Labor Camp under exhaustive conditions. Body failure expected to happen in three weeks with net gain in resources spent.\n[CLOSE FILE]\n\nKitti Luft, escapee, sent to the Kittville Nordarbeit Labor Camp, worked to death.\nGretchen Miauheim, revolutionary, publicly shot.\nLudwig-"
